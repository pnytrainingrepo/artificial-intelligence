# Problem #1: List Practice

Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below. 

def main():
    # Create a list called `fruit_list` that contains the following fruits: 
    # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.
    
    
    # Print the length of the list.

    
    # Add 'mango' at the end of the list. 


    # Print the updated list.


# Problem #2: Index Game

As a warmup, read this code and play the game a few times. Use this mental model of the list:
## Objective:
Create a Python program that helps you practice accessing and manipulating elements in a list. This exercise will help you get comfortable with indexing, slicing, and modifying list elements.

## Instructions:
### Initialize a List:
Create a list with at least 5 different elements. They can be numbers, strings, or a mix of both.

### Accessing Elements:
Write a function that:
- Accepts a list and an index as inputs.
- Returns the element at the specified index.
- If the index is out of range, return an appropriate message.

### Modifying Elements:
Write a function that:
- Accepts a list, an index, and a new value as inputs.
- Replaces the element at the specified index with the new value.
- If the index is out of range, return an appropriate message.

### Slicing the List:
Write a function that:
- Accepts a list, a start index, and an end index as inputs.
- Returns a new list containing the elements from the start index up to (but not including) the end index.
- Handles cases where the indices are out of range.

### Game Interaction:
Create a simple text-based game that:
- Prompts the user to select an operation (access, modify, slice).
- Asks for the necessary inputs (index, new value, etc.).
- Displays the result and the updated list.
